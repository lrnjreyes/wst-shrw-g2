**Project Overview**

Before (Milestone 1)
The website was created using pure HTML and CSS and contained static content without responsiveness or interactivity. Navigation and layout were manually coded, which made expansion and maintenance difficult.

After (Milestone 2 and TA)
The project now uses Bootstrap 5, JavaScript, and jQuery.
A consistent design system, responsive layout, and improved accessibility were applied.
Additional interactivity such as search, hover states, and resource linking was added.
Overall visual identity was improved through custom icons and logo design.

**Bootstrap and Technical Enhancements**

**Bootstrap Components Used**
Responsive navigation bar using navbar-expand-lg, collapse menu, and navbar toggler.
Grid system using container, row, and col classes for layout consistency.
Buttons converted to Bootstrap button classes for uniform styling.
Bootstrap form classes applied to enhance input fields and validation.
Icons integrated using Flaticon and Themify Icons.

**Visual and Code Improvements**
Added cards, badges, and structured sections for cleaner page layout.
Applied CSS overrides to maintain custom project branding.
Updated JavaScript and jQuery functions for toggling, search, scrolling, and validation.
